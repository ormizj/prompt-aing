Currently there are agents which Claude uses, the issue is that when they learn something new, they do not retain the knowledge, the only way for them to retain the knowledge is saving their knowledge in a context file, your job is to create and update the context file, for example: "claude-code-guide" agent, will have "CLAUDE_CODE_GUIDE.md" as a context file, "knowledge-architect" agent will have "KNOWLEDGE_ARCHITECT.md" as a context file, the context files should be located in the /claude-agents directory, before making an agent context file, you should be sure that the agent actually exists, if we do not have a do not have a "backend-dev" do not create a "BACKEND_DEV_AGENT.md" context file
