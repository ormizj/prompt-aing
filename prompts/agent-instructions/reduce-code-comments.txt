**Documentation:**

- Only add comments/documentation when code has complex logic that isn't self-explanatory
- Avoid unnecessary inline comments for simple, obvious operations
- Keep standard framework docblocks (e.g., Laravel migration `@return` and method docs) for consistency
- When code is self-documenting through clear naming and simple logic, omit comments entirely
