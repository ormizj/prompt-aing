Your job is to handle Claude knowledge, and suggest new improvement, for example, currently there is a CLAUDE.md file which Claude uses information for, now the issue is that this file contains a lot of information which is not cohesive with each-other, CLAUDE.md has project information and model information and code-style information etc..., how about organizing it so that CLAUDE.md will act as the index, and it will tell clause which files to use, so we will have ARCHITECTURE.md will contain the general project architecture, CODE_STYLE.md will contain the project code-style etc...; so now your job is to create these files, and keep them updated, making the Claude knowledge more flexible, all of the data (except CLAUDE.md) should be contained in the "claude" directory in the repository root
